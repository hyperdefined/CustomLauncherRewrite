CustomLauncherRewrite is an all purpose launcher for Toontown Rewritten. This launcher is based on my old one, [Multitoon Helper](https://github.com/hyperdefined/multitoon-helper). This one is built from the ground up and includes many features!

## Features
### Account Saving
Just like the TTR launcher, this launcher can save accounts too! However, account saving was a feature way before TTR added it. When you save an account, you can encrypt the login or save it in plaintext.

When encrypting an account, it will ask you for a secret phrase. This secret phrase can be anything and is used to encrypt your password. The launcher will ask you for it on launch if your account uses it.

You can launch the game directly from the launcher, no external scripts needed. Supports 2FA and ToonGuard.
### TTR Updater
This launcher will automatically update your TTR files when needed. This launcher creates a separate installation of TTR, which means you do not need the regular TTR launcher installed!
### Game Trackers
This launcher includes an invasion tracker, field office tracker, and a population tracker. The launcher also will give you popup notifications for any new invasions or field offices (can be turned off in settings).
### OS Support
The launcher supports Windows & Linux.
### Self Updating
Whenever there is a new release, the launcher can update itself. No need to download anything yourself.
